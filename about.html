        <h1>About SBAR</h1>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>The Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation (SBAR) technique is used by healthcare
            organizations worldwide as a standardized communication model to deliver
            information in a structured format. SBAR supplies a concise and accurate
            framework to deliver relevant data that's required to make a decision or to effect
            a change in procedure. Hospitals, practices and other healthcare organizations
            around the world have signifcantly increased safety and quality through SBAR.
            Streamlining information in this way reduces the likelihood of poor communication,
            which is the primary cause of medical errors.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:45px;">Traditionally, SBAR has been used as an informal tool when meeting with a team
            member about a patient's condition or other situation that requires immediate
            attention. Even when prepared in writing, this communication may not be
            recorded. SBAR tools devised for certain clinical situations such as handoffs are
            often considered by staff as too time-consuming to be completed properly. Hence,
            these reports go mostly unread, and the SBAR tools remains underutilized. The
            MyRounding application is purpose-built to streamline this type of communication
            and maximize the effectiveness of this evidence-based process.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:45px;">An electronic SBAR "round" reduces the frequency of communication breakdowns
            by ensuring that all four essential components of effective communication-
            sender, receiver, message and feedback-are operating at peak
            performance. Not only that, similar SBAR reports can provide a
            multiplier effect that pinpoint serious problems. When more than
            one team member sends a report about the same problem, it's
            more likely to be addressed immediately.</p>
