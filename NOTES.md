ASSESSMENT MODAL

Because of the increased noise level, we might be unintentionally causing mistakes and irritating patients who are waiting for treatment.

RECOMMENDATION MODAL

I suggest that we reduce the volume of the music (or not have music at all) and to keep the reception area for patients and ED reception staff only.

SITUATION INFO BUTTON
“What is the situation I want to address?”

Provide information about the situation that needs attention. Identify yourself and your unit in the appropriate fields, then briefly enter what the problem is, when it happened or started, and how severe it is.

Ex: The patient has high blood pressure as of this morning.

Ex: I have an order for a PE study for Mr. Marina. His creatinine is elevated and I wanted to clarify the order with you.

BACKGROUND INFO BUTTON

“What led us to this situation?”

The Background should include a history of the problem and how it evolved to the state that it is now.

Ex: Yesterday the patient’s medication A dosage was increased. Also, medication B was added.

Ex: I see that Mr. Marina came in ED with right-sided chest pain and difficulty breathing. The CT for rule out PE was ordered.

ASSESSMENT INFO BUTTON

“What is going on?”

Give your best evaluation of the situation based on the background information you provided.

Ex: The increase in medication A dosage is causing the patient’s blood pressure to rise.

Ex: Mr Marina’s creatinine level is 2.9, far above our allowable level for a rule-out PE study.”

RECOMMENDATION INFO BUTTON

“What do I want to happen next?”

This is your suggestion on how to proceed to address or solve the problem.

Ex: Decrease the patient’s medication A dosage, or remove medication B.

Ex: I think the order should be changed from a CT for rule-out PE to an order for a VQ scan.

RESOLUTION INFO BUTTON

“How are we acting on the situation?”

Identify steps being taken to resolve the situation.

Ex: I will talk to Doctor Sean to discuss the medication dosage.

Ex: I have cancelled the CT for rule-out PE and ordered a VQ scan for 5/1/17.
